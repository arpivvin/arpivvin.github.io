	<h1>Ariana Venti Went Missing!</h1>
	<h2>I was a Detective for A Day!</h2>
<p>So today was pobably the most interesting day of CS4CS since we put all of our knowledge together to solve a mystery. Right when we entered the classroom, we couldn't help but notice all the posters that were hanging on the walls. Ariana Venti was in the middle of performing at her own concert at Coachella when she went missing! After we heard this news, we all rushed to Ariana's backstage and found a bag- with two boxes of slime and a crumpled up note. We were all relieved, and thought it might be a clue. However,we observed that the words on the note was all jumbled up! Since it most likely was a code that we had to decrypt, we all tried to find the key. As we opened up the slime, there were lettered beads hiding inside of there. One of them said "Is the key" and the other said "The key is in your hands." We imediately thought that slime was the key, and used that with the vigenere cipher to decode the text! According to the vigenere cipher, Ariana was writing to Beyond-C and she said something about knowing a secret on the laptop. How interesting! The investigation is on hold right now, but we all can't wait to get back to bringing Ariana back!</p>
