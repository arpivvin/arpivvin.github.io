<p>Hey guys, it's Arpitha and welcome or welcome back to my blog.To get things started, I recenty learned HTML from a three week long class at NYU called CS4CS.This website was in fact creatd by the sue of HTML. </p>

<p>First off,I am a Libra which means I am pretty balanced-and that is true, I am the most happy when I have everything organized, harmonious, and balanced. My favorite color is yellow,and it reminds me of the sun and to stay positive. I love to read, write,sleep, daydream, and eat.(Specifically chocolate). My hobbies include playing tennis, basketball, dancing,and doodling.That's it for today, but I'll keep you updated on more posts.</p>

<p>xoxo, arpitha :)</p>
